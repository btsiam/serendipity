{"name":"Serendipity","body":"### Serendipity\r\n\r\nWe needed a rails-like approach for the Python language. We tried Django, Flask, etc... but we needed something else... it is like Rails but simpler, faster. Built on top of Python 3 it leverages the language high performance optimizations with the famous Python syntax sugar. Performance and Code Beauty are our goals, our poetry.\r\n\r\nIt's MVC and we focus on conventions like rails, but hey, you can customize it too...\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n/projectX\r\n    /c            -    Controllers\r\n        kit.py    -    The chain-reaction kit file. Where the magic begins.\r\n    /m            -    Models\r\n        db.py     -    The Database Config File. Setup Your model and override mappings.\r\n    /v            -    The Views Directory. All your pyhtml goes here.\r\n    /h            -    Helpers. They're everywhere.\r\n    /i            -    i18n. For you may speak many languages.\r\n    /l            -    Libs. Not for the fainted of heart.\r\n    config.py     -    Here we set the show.\r\n    sdpy          -    ...and start all things.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimplicity is the focus, the whole framework has about 1000 lines of code and is extremely configurable.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nUsing Serendipity you get all of this, out of the box:\r\n\r\n* [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller) Framework\r\n* [Tenjin](http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin) Template Engine w\\ Cache (One of the fastest available for Python)\r\n* [CherryPy](http://cherrypy.org) WebServer with Standalone, WSGI and FastCGI modes\r\n* Security Framework with ACL and per-method permission\r\n* Login Backend\r\n* A very fast i18n support with native Python dicts\r\n* Helpers support\r\n* External libs support\r\n* Auto-Import Controllers (controllers inherit automatically everything from kit, as it is already loaded in memory, we simply map all dependencies to all your controllers, no more 15+ lines of importing on top of your controllers.... just do your thing and import your stuff on kit)\r\n* sdpy controller / model / view generator script\r\n* sdpy server controller (start, stop, restart the webserver)\r\n* sdpy CLI - A client to connect on your database and framework over the terminal\r\n* [SQLAlchemy](http://sqlalchemy.org) + [SQLasagna](http://github.com/ygbr/SQLasagna) based Model (A respectable ORM with a powerfull auto-mapper presenting automatic backref mapping)\r\n* Native model support for [MongoDB](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current)\r\n* General configuration file with Native Python Objects\r\n\r\n### Portability & Customization\r\nThe framework is self-contained, which means you don't need to install it, it always stays inside your project, versioned and tailored to each of your projects specific needs.\r\n\r\n### History\r\nThe Serendipity Framework was built by [ezVoice Telecom](http://ezvoice.com.br) as a base for all new products including IP PBX, Distributed Call Recorders, Unified Communications Solutions, Mobile Apps and etc...\r\nThe development began in March '11 and it is currently being used to drive High Availability Telecommunications systems running on several Banks, Financial Institutions, Carriers and Oil Companies both in Brazil and USA.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* @ygbr - Framework Magician\r\n* @mawkee - Model Magician\r\n* @murilobr - JS Components / Views Magician\r\n* @ecarruda - Linux Magician\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\nDocumentation is at the [Serendipity Wiki](https://github.com/ezvoice/serendipity/wiki) hosted in Github.\r\n\r\n### Issues, Bugs & Support\r\nYou can drop a message to @ygbr here in Github, I'll try to help you ASAP.\r\nFor Bugs and General Issues, use the [Github Issues](http://github.com/ezvoice/serendipity/issues) on the Official [Serendipity](http://github.com/ezvoice/serendipity) Project Page @ Github.\r\n\r\n### On the name\r\n>\r\n> Serendipity means a \"happy accident\" or \"pleasant surprise\"; specifically, the accident of finding something good or useful without looking for it. The word has been voted one of the ten English words hardest to translate in June 2004 by a British translation company.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Python Web Application Framework","google":"UA-31445119-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
